# Maternal Health Risk Analysis

## Overview
This analysis provides insights on key maternal health indicators to uncover risk factors, regional disparities, and service gaps affecting maternal outcomes in Nigeria. The objective is to provide data-driven insights that support policy development, targeted interventions, and improved maternal care delivery.

---

## Problem Statement
Nigeria faces an alarming maternal mortality rate of 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is over 14 times higher than the World Health Organizations's recommended threshold of fewer than 70 deaths. This staggering disparity reflects deep-rooted social,economic, and healthcare system challenges that disproportionality affect women especially in rural and undeserved communities.
Through a detailed analysis of a representative maternal health dataset, the goal of this project is to uncover the key drivers behind the crisis, including limited access to skilled birth attendants, insufficient prenatal care, poverty, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. It also presents data-driven insights and actionable recommendations aimed at reducing maternal deaths and supporting long-term policy interventions for improved maternal health outcomes in Nigeria.

## Data Analysis

## Maternal Health
(Maternal Health Dashboard)
 - Total Healthy Birth Outcome: 7.07k healthy births
 - Maternal Mortality Rate: 7.06k deaths per 100,000 live births
 - Total Birth Complications: 2.47k birth complications 
 - Average number of Children Per Woman : 3 children 
 - Maternal Death by Age Group: Highest death (144 deaths) seen in 40-45 age group and the lowest death (44) seen in age group 25-29
 - Leading Cause of Maternal Death: The leading cause of death is hemorrhage (122) and the least is HIV/AIDS (23)
 - Delivery Method Distribution: 85.6% delivered through the vaginal route and 14.4% through cesarean section 
 - Monthly Death Trends: Ocrober had the highest death count of 56
 - Deaths by Household Income: Low income household had the highest death count of 288, middle income having 16o and high income household having 51 death counts

 - Insight: Maternal mortality in the observed population is critically high, reaching 7,060 deaths per 100,000 live births, far exceeding global health benchmarks and indicating an urgent need for systemic interventions. With 2,470 birth complications, nearly one in three births encounter health issues, pointing to significant gaps in prenatal care and skilled delivery services. The average fertility rate of 3 children per woman continues to place pressure on healthcare systems, especially in under-resourced areas. Women aged 40–45 account for the highest maternal deaths (144), while the lowest (44 deaths) occurs among those aged 25–29, reinforcing the increased risk associated with advanced maternal age. Hemorrhage is the leading cause of death (122 cases), suggesting that many deaths are preventable with timely obstetric care, while HIV/AIDS accounts for the least (23 deaths). Notably, 85.6% of deliveries are by vaginal route , far above WHO recommendations. A spike in deaths during October (56 fatalities) may reflect seasonal vulnerabilities or systemic strain, warranting closer investigation. Lastly, maternal deaths are disproportionately higher among low-income households (288 deaths) compared to middle-income (160) and high-income households (51), highlighting severe healthcare inequities and the necessity for targeted support in vulnerable communities.

## Facility Status
(Facility Dashboard)
- Prenatal Care Coverage: 89.85% coverage
- Postnatal Care Coverage: 70.91% coverage
- Avg Monthly Antenatal Visits: 5 visits
- Facility Readiness Index: 34.09%
- Maternal Death Rates by Skilled Birth Attendants: The highest death rate was recorded in cases of a present skilled birth attendant(56.11%)
- Maternal Deaths by Total Antenatal Visits: the highest maternal death rate recorded in women with 8+ (135) antenal visits and lowest with women with 0-1 visits (46)
- Maternal Deaths by Facility Readiness Level: Ready facility with the highest death of 173, partially ready with 169 and a facilatity not ready with 157
- Total Deaths per Month: The highest death occurred in September (56) and the Least count of death in June(35)
  
- Insight : Despite high prenatal (89.85%) and postnatal (70.91%) care coverage, maternal deaths remain high, suggesting care quality issues. Surprisingly, more deaths occurred among women with 8+ antenatal visits, possibly due to underlying complications. Facilities with higher readiness still recorded the most deaths, indicating that infrastructure alone doesn't guarantee better outcomes. Deaths were also highest where skilled birth attendants were present, pointing to potential issues in emergency response or late-stage interventions. Maternal deaths peaked in September and were lowest in June, hinting at possible seasonal or systemic influences.

## Recommendations 

🏥 1. Focus on Quality, Not Just Coverage
Even with high prenatal (👶) and postnatal (🤱) care rates, deaths remain high. Prioritize quality of care through better training, supervision, and patient-centered services — not just checkboxes.

🔎 2. Investigate High-Risk Antenatal Patterns
Women with 8+ antenatal visits 🗓️ are dying more often, which may indicate unmanaged high-risk pregnancies. Establish risk-tracking systems and create early intervention plans for women with complications.

🚨 3. Strengthen Emergency Obstetric Care
Facilities labeled “ready” 🏥 still show high death rates. Equip all delivery points with life-saving tools, blood supply, and rapid response protocols to handle complications quickly and effectively.

👩‍⚕️ 4. Audit Skilled Birth Attendant Effectiveness
Deaths occurring even when skilled birth attendants 👩‍⚕️👨‍⚕️ are present suggest delays in care or poor decision-making. Conduct performance reviews, simulation-based training, and provide emergency response mentorship.

🧰 5. Upgrade Facility Readiness Across the Board
Even partially ready and unready facilities report high maternal deaths. Ensure basic equipment, protocols, and emergency referral systems are in place at all healthcare levels, not just major centers.

📅 6. Plan for Seasonal Spikes in Deaths
With September showing the highest deaths 📈, examine staffing, disease outbreaks, or access barriers during this period. Implement seasonal health preparedness plans including outreach, staffing, and supply boosts.

# Conclusion
Maternal health surveillance reveals that while service coverage is relatively high, poor care quality, delayed emergency response, and systemic gaps continue to drive preventable maternal deaths. Addressing these issues through improved facility readiness, skilled workforce support, and targeted interventions is essential to reduce mortality and ensure safer outcomes for mothers in Nigeria.
