# Maternal-Health-Risk-Analysis

## Overview
This analysis provides insights on key maternal health indicators to uncover risk factors, regional disparities, and service gaps affecting maternal outcomes in Nigeria. The objective is to provide data-driven insights that support policy development, targeted interventions, and improved maternal care delivery.

---

## Problem Statement
Nigeria faces an alarming maternal mortality rate of 1,047 deaths per 100,000 live births, which is over 14 times higher than the World Health Organization’s recommended threshold of fewer than 70 deaths. This staggering disparity reflects deep-rooted social, economic, and healthcare system challenges that disproportionately affect women—especially in rural and underserved communities.
Through a detailed analysis of a representative maternal health dataset, the goal of this project is to uncover the key drivers behind the crisis, including limited access to skilled birth attendants, insufficient prenatal care, poverty, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. It also presents data-driven insights and actionable recommendations aimed at reducing maternal deaths and supporting long-term policy interventions for improved maternal health outcomes in Nigeria.

## Data Analysis

---

### Home Overview
### 📊 General Statistics
 - Total Cases Reported: 10,000 cases
 - Case Fatality Rate: 49.75% — nearly 1 in 2 reported cases result in death, which is alarmingly high.
 - Confirmed Cases: 50.33%, indicating only half of reported cases are officially confirmed.
 - Average Reporting Delay: 5.03 days, which could significantly hinder timely outbreak response.

### 📈 Monthly Trends
- Peak fatalities were recorded in July (443 deaths) followed by August (433) while April (373) had the lowest number of reported deaths. Despite fluctuations, the overall trend shows sustained high mortality through mid-year.

### Demographic Dashboard
### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Demographics
 Middle-aged individuals (3,348 cases) report slightly more cases than the young (3,422) and old (3,230), indicating a fairly even spread.However, young individuals have the highest number of deaths (1,709), making them the most vulnerable group.

### 🧬 Gender-Based Analysis
 Reports are nearly evenly split with Male (5,020) vs. Female (4,980) and Fatality rates are almost identical with Male: 50.41% and Female: 49.59%. Gender does not appear to be a major factor in mortality.

### 🦠 Disease-Specific Trends
The top 3 diseases by total deaths are Malaria (1,031), Rubella (1,026) and Ebola (1,015) with Lassa Fever having the shortest average delay (4.84 days), while Rubella has the longest (5.11 days). Most diseases show similar reporting delays (~5 days), suggesting a system-wide lag in case reporting.

---
### Location Dashboard
The highest count of cases was recorded in Oyo state (1042 cases) with Borno state having the longest report day of 5.14days. 512 deaths in Rivers, indicating either a severe outbreat or late reporting and 531 confirmed cases in Kano, showing strong detection but possibly still high transmission!

## Recommendations 

---

🏥 1. Enhance Early Detection & Reporting Systems
Target reporting delay reduction to <48 hours, especially for high-fatality diseases like Malaria, Rubella, and Ebola. Implement automated reporting systems or mobile surveillance apps to reduce lag time.

🎯 2. Focus Interventions on Youth Populations
Young individuals are disproportionately affected by fatalities. School-based health campaigns, immunization drives, and protection initiatives should be prioritized for this age group.

📍 3. Deploy Region-Specific Interventions
Increase testing centers and contact tracing capacity to identify sources while launching intensive health education campaigns to promote early reporting and prevention. Community surveillance should also be leveraged involving local healthcare workers for early symptom reporting.

🧪 4. Improve Confirmation Rates
With only 50% of cases confirmed, invest in more testing facilities and faster diagnostic tools. Ensure cases aren't going unverified, especially in rural areas.

🚻 5. Equalize Gender-Based Health Outreach
While fatality rates are equal by gender, ensure balanced access to care, especially in regions with cultural or systemic bias.

📢 6. Policy Advocacy and Capacity Building
Present these findings to health ministries and emergency response teams and push for investment in data infrastructure, real-time dashboards, and field response units.
